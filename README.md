Bombardier is my homage to [brigadier](https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier), a command-line utility that has saved me countless hours troubleshooting Boot Camp driver packages.

## Features

    *   The Boot Camp driver disk image (**DMG**) is automatically extracted from the downloaded Package (**PKG**)
    *   Boot Camp drivers are downloaded to `~/Downloads/Bombardier`
*   [x] Launching Bombardier will automatically update:
    *   The list of Mac Models
    *   The Apple Software Update Server Catalog (**SUCatalog**), used to determine Boot Camp drivers
